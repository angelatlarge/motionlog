Drop down menus:
	1. I don't like the spinner look, want to replace it with a plain button
	2. I tried using the AlertDialogBuilder, however the problem was that alert dialog always sizes to fill up the parent window
	3. On the other hand ListPopupWindow cannot size to content either, as it sizes to the width of the anchored items
